IOTA's vision aims to establish a real-time economy for Internet-of-Things and the future Internet through a secure zero fee payment and data transmission system.
Realizing this vision is subject to a combination of features that cannot be found in current distributed ledger technologies (DLTs): First, a significantly higher throughput is required than in blockchains which have an intrinsic bottleneck, forcing transactions to be aggregated under a chain-type data structure; second, fees can be considered a barrier for micro transactions, but they are necessary in PoW-based DLTs where the network distinguishes between miners and users.
Conversely, IOTA utilizes a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure as explained in the original IOTA white paper~\cite{popov2018} which permits a theoretical infinite throughput\footnote{The actual throughput is bounded by hardware limitations and by laws of physics.}. Furthermore, enabling each network participant to both issue and approve transactions allows IOTA to eliminate the fees found in blockchain architecture, thus facilitating a micropayment-ready network (see also \cite{popov2019feelessfree}).


One common problem for early stage DLTs is that the networks are not robust enough for proposed security mechanisms to function as intended, since such security mechanisms presuppose a mature network. Therefore, it is typical that DLTs employ various ``bootstrapping'' security measures at the outset, ensuring network growth to the mature stage can take place\footnote{%For example, Bitcoin has in the past employed checkpoints. 
See e.g.\ \url{https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Checkpoint_Lockin}
for an example of a security mechanism of this sort}. Thus, in its current implementation, IOTA relies on a centralized Coordinator to provide security given the risk of dishonest actors seeking to undermine the nascent network. IOTA's definition of consensus requires a confirmed transaction to be referenced (either directly or indirectly) by a signed transaction issued by the Coordinator. In other words, the Coordinator can be thought of as a ``finality device''.

We believe that the vision of cryptocurrency networks based on Nakamoto consensus can be improved upon by changing the key underlying assumption about those controlling the majority of the network's hashing power being considered \enquote{honest} by definition (the ``longest chain wins'' rule). In IOTA, the requirement for honest actors to control a majority of the network's hashing power is currently replaced by the use of the Coordinator. The Coordinator is a temporary measure as the IOTA network develops beyond Nakamoto's vision for network consensus.
The Coordicide project is focused on the removal of the Coordinator through the implementation of several network components, as discussed in this working paper. 
Despite these additional components, all existing fundamental design features of the Tangle remain in-place.

In line with the IOTA Foundation's charter as a non-profit organization, our goals as a research department include transparency, collaboration, and community engagement. We aim to open our research work in order to obtain feedback from academia as well as the broad community of enthusiasts. Since we have released the IOTA white paper, we have indeed seen a flourishing literature, would it be people analysing and proposing improvements on the protocol itself \cite{Attias2019_netys, bramas2019, DeRoode2018, Ince2018, Janecko2018, Stucchi2019}, building systems on top of the IOTA protocol \cite{Brogan2018, Chiang2018, Memon2018, Zhang2019} or studying the market viability \cite{Bartolomeu2018, Dasgupta2019, Florea2018, Raschendorfer2019}. One note of caution, however, is in order: Since our research is highly dynamic in nature, proposed ideas need to be simulated and tested in order to develop specific network components which we feel confident to deploy on the main network. We stress that some of the ideas presented here are works in progress and as such are not fully fleshed out. They are therefore likely to be modified as we make progress and perform simulations.

At a high level, our vision for the Coordicide can be explained in the following way. 
We are looking for a \emph{probabilistic consensus} --- with probability very close to $1$, all honest participants of the network would agree on which transactions should be considered valid.
It is important to remark that one should not be afraid of the probabilistic nature of it --- if something occurs with strictly
positive probability, this doesn't yet mean it would ever occur 
\emph{in practice}\footnote{As a quick example,
try guessing at least one private key from Bitcoin addresses which belong to Satoshi; yet, the probability that a random 256-bit number is
one of those private keys is strictly positive.}.
Another important idea is that, while we do need \emph{total} consensus 
on what is really important (transactions' validity), we may not need total consensus on everything. Therefore, we may
use an \emph{approximate} consensus\footnote{For example, on \emph{time} 
--- it is something on which the approximate consensus already exists; another example when the total consensus is not necessary is the common sequence of random numbers: as explained below, it is already enough if most of the participants agree on the same number frequently enough.} 
to achieve the total one with high probability. 
It is also a feature of our approach that the consensus (on transactions' validity) is an \emph{attracting state} in the following sense: small deviations from the absolute consensus on secondary things (e.g., local clocks, random number sequence that the nodes see, mana vectors) with high probability do not lead to deviations from consensus on transactions' validity. 
Still, we keep the basic protocol simple: the only ``hard'' rule remains to be that a new transaction should approve two other transactions; 
what eventually stays in the main tangle (not orphaned), 
is valid\footnote{One of the reasons why we prefer using this approach, 
is the following:
if we allow conflicting transactions on the Tangle, 
 this has to go coupled with a precise conflict-resolution rule, 
 which can be never changed and likely has ``long-range'' dependencies.}.
The above is in line with the idea that ``IOTA is free'' \cite{popov2019feelessfree}. 
This is because the actors will have flexibility to adapt the system to different environments by only adjusting the node's behaviors.


In order to get rid of the Coordinator, a number of challenges must be solved. This working paper covers those challenges, which are summed up by the building blocks in Fig.~\ref{fig:building-blocks}. In the following, we give a concise overview about the current state of the Coordicide as well as future research directions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Node accountability}. In Section~\ref{sec:node_acc} we propose the concept of \emph{global node IDs} and we describe a novel Sybil protection mechanism that does not require node owners to risk or disclose their funds. Identifying the issuing node of a message is fundamental to enforce a specific network topology (through autopeering) or to penalize bad behaviours (through rate control).
    
    \item \textit{Autopeering and node discovery}. 
    An automated process to discover and reliably connect to neighbors is needed in every distributed system. In Section~\ref{sec:peering} we discuss an autopeering proposal for the IOTA network.

    \item \textit{Rate control}.
    To ensure the network does not exceed its capacity, in Section~\ref{sec:rate_control} we introduce a mechanism to control the rate of transactions that are propagated through the network. This method selectively filters some transactions out according to the statistics of the issuing node.

    
    \item \textit{Consensus and Voting}.
    The previous building blocks lead to an extended consensus framework described in Section~\ref{sec:consensus}. The new protocol does not use the tip selection algorithm as a tool for consensus, although it is still has its importance as it can be seen in Section~\ref{sec:tsa}. Instead, it proactively resolves conflicts through voting. We describe two voting mechanisms where nodes query other nodes to find out their current opinion on the network status (Section~\ref{sec:consensus}).
    
        \item \textit{Tip Selection}
    With the decoupling from the consensus mechanism, the tip selection algorithm has more freedom to achieve a better performance in its other tasks, as keeping the good structure of the network, demotivating lazy behavior and quickly approve new honest transactions. In Section~\ref{sec:tsa} we talk about the impact and motivation of the tip selection, as well as present more details on our main proposal for a new tip selection algorithm.
