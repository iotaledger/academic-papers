@article{Frederiksen,
abstract = {We present two new, highly efficient, protocols for securely generating a distributed RSA key pair in the two-party setting. One protocol is semi-honestly secure and the other maliciously secure. Both are constant round and do not rely on any specific number-theoretic assumptions and improve significantly over the state-of-the-art by allowing a slight leakage (which we show to not affect security). For our maliciously secure protocol our most significant improvement comes from executing most of the protocol in a "strong" semi-honest manner and then doing a single, light, zero-knowledge argument of correct execution. We introduce other significant improvements as well. One such improvement arrives in showing that certain, limited leakage does not compromise security, which allows us to use lightweight subprotocols. Another improvement, which may be of independent interest, comes in our approach for multiplying two large integers using OT, in the malicious setting, without being susceptible to a selective-failure attack. Finally, we implement our malicious protocol and show that its performance is an order of magnitude better than the best previous protocol, which provided only semi-honest security. This article is based on an earlier article: [FLOP18], c IACR 2018 10.1007/978-3-319-96881-0$\backslash$ 12.

abstract = {The problem of generating an RSA composite in a distributed manner without leaking its factorization is particularly challenging and useful in many cryptographic protocols. Our first contribution is the first non-generic fully simulatable protocol for distributively generating an RSA composite with security against malicious behavior. Our second contribution is complete Paillier [Pai99] threshold encryption scheme in the two-party setting with security against malicious behavior. Furthermore, we describe how to extend our protocols to the multiparty setting with dishonest majority. Our RSA key generation is comprised of the following: (i) a distributed protocol for generation of an RSA composite, and (ii) a biprimality test for verifying the validity of the generated composite. Our Paillier threshold encryption scheme uses the RSA composite as public key and is comprised of: (i) a distributed generation of the corresponding secret-key shares and, (ii) a distributed decryption protocol for decrypting according to Paillier.},

ABSTRACT = {A financial time series agent-based model is reproduced and investigated by the statistical physics system, the finite-range interacting voter system. The voter system originally describes the collective behavior of voters who constantly update their positions on a particular topic, which is a continuous-time Markov process. In the proposed model, the fluctuations of stock price changes are attributed to the market information interaction amongst the traders and certain similarities of investors’ behaviors. Further, the complexity of return series of the financial model is studied in comparison with two real stock indexes, the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index and the Hang Seng Index, by composite multiscale entropy analysis and recurrence analysis. The empirical research shows that the simulation data for the proposed model could grasp some natural features of actual markets to some extent.},

	Abstract = {The decision making process in a society is studied in the context of two-dimensional cellular automata. We obtained the critical value of the order parameter below which this artificial society never reaches a consensus. It is found that a phase transition occurs at a certain value of the order parameter that represents the strength of interaction between agents, just as temperature in the phase transition in the physical systems. The relation between this order parameter and Langton's Î»-parameter is studied. Wolfram's totalistic rules are investigated in two dimension with five neighbors.},

	Abstract = {Suppose in a graph G vertices can be either red or blue. Let k be odd. At each time step, each vertex v in G polls k random neighbours and takes the majority colour. If it does not have k neighbours, it simply polls all of them, or all less one if the degree of v is even. We study this protocol on graphs of a given degree sequence, in the following setting: initially each vertex of G is red independently with probability {\^I}$\pm$<12, and is otherwise blue. We show that if {\^I}$\pm$ is sufficiently biased, then with high probability consensus is reached on the initial global majority within O(logklogkn) steps if 5{\^a}Ââ¬k{\^a}Ââ¬d, and O(logdlogdn) steps if k>d. Here, d{\^a}ÂÂ¥5 is the effective minimum degree, the smallest integer which occurs {\^I}Â(n) times in the degree sequence. We further show that on such graphs, any local protocol in which a vertex does not change colour if all its neighbours have that same colour, takes time at least {\^I}{\copyright}(logdlogdn), with high probability. Additionally, we demonstrate how the technique for the above sparse graphs can be applied in a straightforward manner to get bounds for the Erd{\H o}s--R{\'e}nyi random graphs in the connected regime.},

	Abstract = {We report a preliminary investigation on interactions between networked social communities using the Ising model to analyze the spread of rumours. The inner opinion of a given community is forced to change through the introduction of a unique external source and we analyze how the other communities react to this change. We model two conceptual external sources: namely, ``Strong-belief'', and ``Propaganda'', by an infinitely strong inhomogeneous external field and a finite uniform external field, respectively. In the former case, the community changes independently from other communities while in the latter case according also to interactions with the other communities. We apply our model to synthetic networks as well as various real world data ranging from human physical contact networks to online social networks. The experimental results using real world data clearly demonstrate two distinct scenarios of phase transitions.},

It has the potential to extract a wealth of information from “big data” collected at the population level, to enhance preventive and precision medicine at the patient level. This may improve efficiency and quality while decreasing cost of healthcare delivered by professionals. However, there are still security and privacy issues that need to be addressed before algorithms, data, and models can be mobilized safely at scale. In this paper we discuss how distributed ledger technologies can play a key role in advancing electronic health, by ensuring authenticity and integrity of data generated by wearable and embedded devices. We demonstrate how the Masked Authenticated Messaging extension module of the IOTA protocol can be used to securely share, store, and retrieve encrypted activity data using a tamper-proof distributed ledger."

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm of devices embedded with sensors, actuators and trans-receivers, connected wirelessly in a network. With the advent of IoT, with a projection of 7.1 trillion IoT devices by 2020, comes various challenge such as secure connections, long lasting battery power and so on. The block chain technology in IoT has become popular in various fields such as providing secure connections for crypto-currency transactions. However, the usage of Direct Acyclic Graphs (DAG) formed in a block-less system, and ternary operators instead of the binary, provides much faster response rates with a higher data handling rate. So, the use of DAGs has found its applications in fields such as crypto currency owing to its high scalability rate. DAGs can be used to/in compress and process data, causal networks, scheduling, crypto currency, etc. which can be further use in the Internet of Things such as longer lasting battery power as the number of devices increase. Ternary operators reduces the overall workload than a binary system. This paper focusses on how the block-less system can be a better option than a blockchain by making a review on the Internet of Things Application (IOTA) by comparing it closely to bitcoin, which uses the blockchain technology.",

abstract = "Recently, the manufacturing industry became aware of distributed ledger technologies, a protocol that, amongst other things, allows trustless transactions between machines. In this paper, we investigate whether an M2M economy would be feasible within the IOTA network, a popular cryptocurrency for IoT. We build and present a simple industrial lot-size one production system involving three agents that cooperate to create an artistic painting. Payments between agents and users are autonomously executed via IOTA. Amongst other points of criticism, we found that an M2M economy would benefit from the support of smart-contracts and conclude that IOTA is not a fitting solution."
